### Hi, my name is Stanislav!

A seasoned software engineer with over 9 years of experience in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), I possess strong expertise in algorithms, Python, Java, and Golang, focusing on building scalable, high-load RESTful web services and microservices.

My career highlights include leading successful transitions to microservices, optimizing system performance, and collaborating effectively with multinational agile teams to drive innovation. I am excited to apply my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to a Senior Software Engineer or Lead Software Engineer position.

I look forward to contributing to innovative projects and advancing technological progress.
